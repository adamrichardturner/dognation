# Dognation | Passport.js Exercise

This project was primarily taken from [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) and serves as a reference for me for building a basic authentication system using [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/)

The project files do not include the Frontend. This project should serve only as a reference piece, and is not for production use.
